					<h2>Research mission</h2>
					<h3>In short</h3>
					The overarching philosophy of my work is this: by <b>learning</b> from the massive amounts of software-related data out there, we can <b>reduce</b> the redundancies and complexities of
					software development to make software engineering <b>accessible</b> to all. Here, I believe, lies the solution to the software crisis.
					
					<h3>In full</h3>
					I think we can all agree: <span style="color:#aa0000">software development is hard, software engineering even harder.</span>
					But as complicated as it may be, <span style="color:#00aa00">software is also awesome!</span>
					For the first time in history we can automate anything that we can <a href="http://vhellendoorn.blogspot.com/p/whats-deal-with-computer-science.html">describe in sufficient detail</a>.
					Studying why software is hard is key: it can enable us to build tools to reduce these difficulties, perhaps even code collaboratively, and hopefully allow us to bring the power to write good software to many people.
					<br />
					<br />
					So, the primary focus of my research is to simplify software development for the masses.
					Software Engineering is key here, as it adds discipline and rigour to the far-from-simple task of creating "good" software.
					In practice, however, software engineering remains a fuzzy concept.
					Questions that are fundamental to an engineering discipline (What defines "good code"? What design principles should we use when?)
					remain only partially answered and differently so in many domains.
					<br />
					<br />
					I believe that we must study code in the real world to answer questions such as the above.
					Thus, I focus on <a href="http://2015.msrconf.org/">Mining Software Repositories</a> and general Empirical Software Engineering.
					I look for code that development communities find <a href="http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/natural.pdf">natural</a> (and the <a href="Publications.html#icse16">reverse</a>) and study its properties.
					These properties can then be turned into <a href="Publications.html#icse15">tools</a> to make developing software easier.
					I investigate how people <a href="Publications.html#msr15">collaborate</a>, focusing on how we can support maintainers and contributors alike to improve the evolution of source code.
					
					<h2>Other activities</h2>
					In my spare-time, I try to regularly take on projects that are either "just-off" my main research or completely out there. This helps me relax and broaden my horizon.
					Current topics of interest are (Deep) Neural Networks, Optimization Problems, twin primes and the (cursed) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a>.
					<br />
					I also try to stay up to date with the latest changes in software development; a task that's surprisingly difficult as a full-time researcher!
					I'm quite fond of IDEs, especially IntelliJ recently and I'll try my hand at Web/App dev from time to time to see what has changed. 
					Recently I have worked with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vhellendoorn/activity/" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Try my Github Tracker :)">Docker</a>
					(and taught it immediately afterwards as part of a course I am TA'ing), Android and bits of React.
					My goal is to convert as much of my research as possible into various kinds of workable tools.
