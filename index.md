# Welcome!
I am an Assistant Professor in computer science at CMU, where I build intelligent tools for software engineering. My work focuses on using machine learning for software engineering (commonly called ML4SE/AI4SE). I study how developers communicate their expectations when writing software, how we can learn from these effectively, and I identify downstream applications and build the corresponding tools that such models unlock.

# Collaborations with Industry
SE research is most impactful when we maintain a connection to software development companies. That is not to say that all our papers must have practical application, but rather that our broader research agenda should be at least partially informed by an understanding of computer programming in practice. I maintain these ties through frequent collaboration with industrial partners, including part-time employment (I was a visiting faculty at Google), research grants & collaborations (incl. with IBM, Google), and various other visits (incl. past internships at Microsoft). My door is always open for new industry collaborations! [Contact me](#contact) if interested.

## Google Brain
As a visiting researcher (one day per week), I study characteristics and modeling implications of how developers write code from big data.

## IBM
We study the relation of code and natural language in several practical setting in this (grant-based) collaboration.

## Microsoft Research
Worked with several researchers on topics including type inference and invariant detection, from a machine learning perspective.
